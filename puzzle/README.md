# [Classic Puzzle Maker](https://krishealty.github.io/puzzle/example.html)

A simple implementation of the classic mini-game Fifteen Sliding Puzzle, using HTML DOM document elements and without using Canvas or third party libraries. 

When mixing a picture, random replacement of slots is not used, only natural mixing by moving a free slot, thanks to this, an error is excluded, due to which the puzzle may not be assembled.

By solving the puzzle, you can move several blocks in a column and a row in one move. You can set controls for the GamePad and keyboard.

The engine code is very flexible for modifications, has many settings and can be integrated into any web page or web app.
