## How to Play
1. The goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over.
2. Players are initially dealt two cards and can choose to "Hit" (get another card) or "Stand" (end their turn).
3. The dealer will reveal their hidden card once the player stands and will hit or stand based on the total hand value.
4. If the player's hand exceeds 21, they lose (bust). The same goes for the dealer.
5. Whoever has the closest hand to 21 without busting wins.
